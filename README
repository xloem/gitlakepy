git-annex-remote-w3-subprocess

git-annex-remote-siaskynet
  A remote for Sia Skynet's http webportals.
  It was taking me too long to download the blockchain when I wrote this
  to write something that directly interfaced with it.  May change.

  Usage:
  $ git annex initremote skynet chunk=128MiB type=external encryption=<type> externaltype=siaskynet

  Additional Options:
    None configured.


git-annex-remote-bsv
  A remote for Bitcoin SV's B:// and BCAT:// protocols, using the bitsv and polyglot libraries.
  Like siaskynet, this is mostly just using third party servers for now, but bitsv does support connecting
  directly to a local node.
  Right now the code needs xloem's 'merged' branch of the polyglot library: https://github.com/xloem/polyglot
  
  Usage:
  $ git annex initremote bsv type=external encryption=<type> externaltype=bsv key=<private key in WIF format>
 
  Additional Options:
    confirmations=4
      The number of block confirmations to wait for before confirming storage of a file.
      To store quickly and wait after, you can set this to 1 or 0 with enableremote, upload,
      and then afterwards set it back to 4 or so and let `git annex fsck -f bsv` do the waiting.

    fee=0.5
      The number of satoshis per byte to pay for uploads.  Higher fees produce faster acceptance by the network.
      It may be possible to lower this to 0.25 if the user has a few hours of patience and the API server
      is willing.

    network=main
      The network to connect to.  The other two networks are 'test' and 'stn', which are likely to be
      very cheap but could occasionally delete everything.


git-annex-remote-freenet
  A freenet remote for git-annex.

  Usage:
  $ git annex initremote freenet type=external encryption=<type> externaltype=freenet

  Additional Options:
    priority=0
      Set the priority of the freenet interactions.  Higher numbers are less aggressive.

    persistence=reboot
      May be 'connection', 'reboot', or 'forever'.  How long to keep a transfer going in the background if interrupted.

    timeout=60
      Number of seconds to wait when checking for content before assuming it has been lost.

    chkonly=
      If set, upload nothing to freenet, only generate urls.

    localonly=
      If set, ignore the larger freenet network and only work with the local datastore.
