SCRIPTS

git-annex-remote-siaskynet
  A freenet remote for Sia Skynet's http webportals.
  It was taking me too long to download the blockchain when I wrote this
  to write something that directly interfaced with it.  May change.

  Usage:
  $ git annex initremote skynet chunk=128MiB type=external encryption=<type> externaltype=siaskynet

  Additional Options:
    None configured.


git-annex-remote-freenet
  A freenet remote for git-annex.

  Usage:
  $ git annex initremote freenet type=external encryption=<type> externaltype=freenet

  Additional Options:
    priority=0
      Set the priority of the freenet interactions.  Higher numbers are less aggressive.

    persistence=reboot
      May be 'connection', 'reboot', or 'forever'.  How long to keep a transfer going in the background if interrupted.

    timeout=60
      Number of seconds to wait when checking for content before assuming it has been lost.

    chkonly=
      If set, upload nothing to freenet, only generate urls.

    localonly=
      If set, ignore the larger freenet network and only work with the local datastore.
